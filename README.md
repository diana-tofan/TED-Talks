# TED-Talks
TED Talks are popular and insightful, but not all TED talks are equal. Some get tens of thousands of more views than others, so we hope to look into what makes a TED Talk popular. We will look at the tags, the key-words, the groups, and do some moral/sentiment analysis on a database of over 2,000 TED talks and transcripts. We will then search for patterns in our segmented data, and see if we can learn anything about what makes an idea spread and tick. We will use a database of over 2,000 TED talks and transcripts.
